What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git hidden folder is created to the main folder to add the version control
    configuration to your project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area prepares the files to be committed into the repository
    It helps as an intermediate step before executing the commit to make sure
    all the files changed are committed at the right point in time

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Before you add to the stage area the changes you will commit compare it to
    the working directory and review the changes.
