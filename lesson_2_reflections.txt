What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  A .git hidden folder is created to the main folder to add the version control
  configuration to your project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area prepares the files to be committed into the repository
  It helps as an intermediate step before executing the commit to make sure
  all the files changed are committed at the right point in time
