When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you have a project with other contribuitors, that can be any part 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because that way you know the remote changes that you are including in your local repository
